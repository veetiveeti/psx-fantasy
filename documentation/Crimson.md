The world is bound in eternal night. There are two moons. The planes of existence leak into the world like a plague. 

The world is isolated, with remnants of civilization descending into barbarism and feudal paranoia, greed and wars. Between points of faint light there is only wilderness and ruins.

Long ago a conclave of sages discovered that reality itself was under siege by entities that exist in the spaces between whispers. When ancient gods dream, the barriers between the planes of existence weaken and form gateways. The gateways leak terrible creatures and the curse of undeath.

A king obsessed with these ancient gods sacrifised his people to gain audience with the gods.
